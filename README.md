This project performs simple linear regression on a dataset containing students' study hours and corresponding scores. The goal is to predict the student's score based on the number of hours they studied.

Steps performed in the code:

1. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named "Hours and Scores.csv".
2. Data is split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio.
3. A linear regression model is trained on the training set.
4. Predictions are made on the test set.
5. Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score are calculated to evaluate the model.
6. A scatter plot is displayed showing actual data points and the regression line.

This project uses the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scikit-learn

The code is suitable for beginners learning regression and basic machine learning concepts.
